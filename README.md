Training ANN model on heart diesase dataset, 50 startup dataset, mobile dataset.
In this file ANN model is trained on three different datsets as mentioned. The task in the heart disease dataset is to train ANN model to classify whether patient is suffering from heart disease or not.
Next, the ANN model for multiclass classification is applied where classification of mobile is done into various price ranges .
For 50 startup dataset ANN model is trained to predict the profit for each company.

In ANN model part 2 file the dataset provided are CIFAR10, house price prediction and churn modelling.
In this file ANN model is trained on the above 3 mentioned datasets. The task in the CIFAR 10 is to deal with images(10 classes proved). So to classify these images into their corrresponding classes.
Then the ANN model is trained for multiple linear regression on house price prediction dataset.
The ANN model for binary classification is applied on churn modelling dataset .y.

Training ANN model on heart diesase dataset, 50 startup dataset, mobile dataset.
In this file ANN model is trained on three different datsets as mentioned. The task in the heart disease dataset is to train ANN model to classify whether patient is suffering from heart disease or not.
Next, the ANN model for multiclass classification is applied where classification of mobile is done into various price ranges .
For 50 startup dataset ANN model is trained to predict the profit for each company.

In ANN model part 2 file the datasets provided are CIFAR10, house price prediction and churn modelling.
In this file ANN model is trained on the above 3 mentioned datasets. The task in the CIFAR 10 is to deal with images(10 classes proved). So to classify these images into their corrresponding classes.
Then the ANN model is trained for multiple linear regression on house price prediction dataset.
The ANN model for binary classification is applied on churn modelling dataset.

In ANN model part 3 file the datasets provided are MNIST, Dog Vs Cat and chinese traffic sign database.
All the datasets contain images and ANN is trained for image classification.
For MNIST digit dataset, multiclass classification is performed for 10 classes(digit-0 to digit-9).
Dog Vs Cat classification is binary classification for 2 classes: dogs and cats.
Chinese traffic sign database is again multiclass classification divided into 58 catgories.

Finally, ANN with batch normalization as regularization technique is apllied on part4 having afshion MNIIST and heart failure prediction dataset.
On applying the regularization techniques like batch normalization, we can ovserve that it prevents data from overfitting and hence better results with good accuracy can be obained.
